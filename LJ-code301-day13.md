#Learning Journal Day 13

##Today I learned about routes and how the connect with the MVC concept of making single page web apps.  I pair programmed with Zach, and albeit we had a rough start, but as soon as we realized that the class demo was not something to use for reference, it made the coding a lot more simple.  I also learned how frustrating installing and/or updating postgres can be on linux.  It took Nick the better part of hour to help me get a working version so that I could get my code to run during the driving part of our pair programming.  I'm getting the functionality of my portfolio page accomplished day by day after doing the pair programming assignments, but I still haven't given the css much thought.  It just seems like getting it to work should be more of a priority in my mind.
