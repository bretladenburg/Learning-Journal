#Learning Journal Day 6

##Today I learned some new information about AJAX calls, and how it integrates with JSON.  We went over the basic functionalites of these concepts in class, but I feel like I will have more questions on this when it comes to actually putting the skills into practice.  I also learned a method for searching through a linked list to determine if a value was the same as any of the others.  I feel like i'm falling behind slightly, because I still need to get my handlebars working with my portfolio page, but hopefully I can get that working by the end of this JS Hack event.
