#Learning Jounal Day 16

##Today was a great first day for our project, we got a great start on the front page of the site and the functionality of the game.  James and Tim worked on the bulk of the javascript while Max and I designed the board and made it look the way we wanted it too.  We also did some javascript by adding in the event listeners for the nav button and local storage issues.
