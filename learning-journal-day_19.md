#Learning Journal Day 19

##Today I learned that after 4 weeks of coding and losing interest in keeping up your appearance and then suddenly showing up on presentation day looking nice, people tend to notice.  It's presentation day and our project is done, it's been done since yesterday but we are meeting early today to run through our exactly what we are going to say and who is going to say what.  I feel pretty prepared for today, but more rehearsal can't hurt.  I am excited to show our project to our class so they can see all the hard work we've been doing this whole week.
