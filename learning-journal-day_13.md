#Learning Journal Day 13

##Today I learned how frustrating data persistence can be in javascript.  We did partner programming today and David and we seemed to get it down only after James helped us understand it.  I like how this site is coming together and we can see all of the moving parts of how to build a site such as this.  I think that during project week it's going to be stressful because it's going to be this type of working environment but with less structure.  It's going to be on us in order to get everything done.
