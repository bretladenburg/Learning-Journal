#Learning Journal Day 6

## Today I could feel the full force of the curriculum coming down on me.  I thought that I was good on dealing with objects, but boy was I wrong.  It expecially got hard when we had to incorporate the DOM with the different javascript functions that we were writing.  At least i'm in the same boat as a lot of people in my class, they all seem to be struggling with the same aspects as me.  Today I learned a lot about the appendChild method and I really seemed to grasp that well at least.  Hopefully tomorrow will be a bit better.
