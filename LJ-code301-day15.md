#Learning Journal Day 15

##Today I learned the fate of my project team.  When I say that, I mean in the sense that we have a lot of work ahead of us to do for project week.  I'm in a group with Brandon and David, and we did a pretty good job of wireframing our project.  Nick and the TA's signed off on it which is a good sign, although they did mention that it would be A LOT of work, and when they say that it gives me some hesitations.  Brandon and I put up close to 16 issues on github to start with, but I feel like we are gonna have a lot more coming.  Both Brandon and I agree that a huge part of the project will be interacting with the API that we have chosen and creating the tables for our database.  I'm excited to work with my partners for project week, but I also know that we are going to spend a lot of long nights here.
