#Learning Journal Day 11

##Today I learned about iffe's and higher order functions.  On paper it seems like a much easier way to write code, but I just started getting used to the ways that they've been teaching us so it's a little bit overwhelming right now.  I also helped the TA's realize that my code wasn't broken when they were grading it, but that what was in local storage on their machines was causing some confusion when they tried to load my page on localhost:3000.  I'm not gonna lie, it gave me a little bit a scare when they said that my code was broken.  I also need to really focus on this blog article post because my grade is like 83 percent because I didn't finish it yet.  I think i want to research how game devs make games from the ground up and offer my blog post as a teaching reference.
