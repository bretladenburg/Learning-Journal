#Learning Journal Day 5

## Today was pretty cool actually, I got to see some really impressive presentations from students in the 401 classes.  When I look at them and see the wealth of knowledge and experience that they have gained in such a short amount of time it gives me hope that I can achieve the same success.  The lab work that Nick gave us today was different that the other days, in the sense that we weren't creating new code but solving problems that he had pre written for us.  At first the problems seemed daunting, but I realized that not only could I go in the test.js file and look at exactly what Nick was testing for but I could even troubleshoot it in the browser console as well.  I will admit that on multiple occasions I got error messages simply because I didn't write out the strings Nick provided EXACTLY.  At the end of the first week I feel pretty exhausted but I know that if I just keep plugging on and dive head first into this that I can do it.  Although I am slightly concerned for next week..
