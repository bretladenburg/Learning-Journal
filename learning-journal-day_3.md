#Day 3

##Today was pretty intense, in the sense that I was asking the TA's a lot of questions.  Albiet a lot of it involved github and how to navigate the terminal without breaking anything important.  As usual the finer aspects of css still seem to elude me, however I am making progress on javascript.  Hopefully I can really get using github down by the end of the week.  Today I learned how to use a counter to track correct answers in javascript, and I also learned how to use "for" loops.
